# Concept Lab

A repo for me to try out new ideas in and explore computer science concepts.

## Status: Inactive No Warranty

This is code I have thrown together to test out some ideas. It is definitely not production ready. I am not currently doing any development on it.

### Contents

* DataStructures - Symmetric recursive OO linked list and doubly linked list with visitors
* ExtendableObjects - Type safe dynamic object attributes
* LanguageLimitations - Demonstrates weaknesses in the C# language in the areas of generics and implicit conversions
* PureObjects - Implements logic and math using no primitives, only objects with polymorphic methods. Shows that objects and dynamic dispatch are probably turing complete
